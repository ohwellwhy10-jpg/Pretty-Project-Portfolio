"""PreToolUse gates for the enforced house rules.

preflight       no browser (browser MCP tools, or a shell command that drives one) until the
                browser-agent-preflight skill has run in this session.
opening_audit   no edits, commits or pushes until the ponytail-audit skill has run in this session.
no_attribution  no Co-Authored-By or Claude-Session lines in a commit (or its -F file) in a public repo or a fork,
                no credit lines in what is posted to one through GitHub, and, after a post GitHub's integration
                signs (PostToolUse), the session is told to edit the footer off.
ship, merge     pushes, branch deletions and merges, in ship_gate.py.
small_writers   the plugin's scout and tester never edit; in a repo that merges its own pull requests, no sub agent
                on a model off the strong list edits a tracked file (the merging rule's promise: a strong model did
                the work).
right_sized     delegate first: an Agent spawn, every agent() in a Workflow script and a new session
                (create_session) name their model on the call, or are refused; where Charlotte has capped a repo's
                sub agents, a model named above her cap is refused too (right_sized.py).

The gates fail closed: one that can't read the house rules refuses the call rather than waving it through.
