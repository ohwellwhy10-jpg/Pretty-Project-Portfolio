"""The right_sized rule, delegate first: an assignment costs what its model costs, so it names that model on the call.

Charlotte, 5 October: "Always run the delegation before assigning anything to anyone." Every assignment names its
model on the call, whatever this session runs and whether or not she has capped the repo: an Agent (or Task) spawn
its `model`, every agent() call in a Workflow script the `model` in its own options, and a new Claude Code Remote
session (create_session) its `model`. One that names none, or names something off the ladder, is refused with the
rubric for choosing. A fork is the one exception: it is the parent by design, and its model can't be chosen.

Facts only. The hook judges the model the call names, the one fact it can see, and nothing else:

- It never guesses whether a task is easy from its words. That is the decide tool's `easy` preset, the rubric of
  docs/delegation.md. (Only a refusal's wording reads the prompt, to tell a held, private or browser task to stay on
  a strong tier; it decides nothing.)
- It never works out what an unnamed spawn would resolve to. Claude Code resolves that from two environment
  variables, the agent's own file and the session's model, and every reimplementation of it here drifted into a
  bypass one way or a false refusal the other. So a helper whose file pins Haiku (the scout, the tester) names haiku
  on the call like any other.

Her cap: `tiers.ceiling` in a repo's `.claude/catio-rules.json` caps its sub agents. A spawn or an agent() call that
names a model above it is refused, and so is every sub agent while CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE, which overrides
the call, is above it. A cap written in a shape the rule can't use is said, once, rather than going quiet (misread()).

Nothing here switches the session's own model: the tier is chosen for the work being assigned, because switching the
conversation mid-way throws its prompt cache away and costs more than the routing saves.
