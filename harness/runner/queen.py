"""The queen's runner: the brain of the queen of the KittyChat Café, on Charlotte's own computer.

The queen is the cat in the café's entrance hall that Charlotte talks to. This waits on the gateway
(harness/gateway) for what she says to the queen and for the routines she set up, runs one Claude Code turn for
each, signed in with her own plan, with the Catio's tools as the queen's only tools, and streams what the queen
says back, so every open café shows it as she speaks. Stop, in the café, ends the turn.

    python3 harness/runner/queen.py

Environment:
    CATIO_URL        the gateway's address, https://catio-gateway.<name>.workers.dev
    CATIO_QUEEN      the queen's own key (the CATIO_QUEEN secret on the Worker), never the agents' key
    CATIO_QUEEN_DIR  where she keeps her state and works from (default ~/.catio/queen)
    CATIO_CLAUDE     the claude command, when it isn't on the PATH as "claude"
    CATIO_NOTIFY     a program to say homework on her desktop instead of the platform's own; it is called
                     with the text as its one argument. Set it empty for no notifications at all.

README.md says how to set it up. Standard library only; Python 3.9 or later.
