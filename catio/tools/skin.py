"""List her own art for the page: art/skin/ in, art/skin.json out.

    python3 catio/tools/skin.py           ->  catio/art/skin.json, and what each file fills or why it can't

Every piece of the café is a slot (ART in catio/index.html, named as docs/drawing-plan.md names her files).
Drop a drawing in catio/art/skin/ under its slot's name (panel.png, cat-meow.png, font.ttf...), run this, and
the page draws with it: no code changes. It reads each PNG's size and checks it as the page does: the house,
the grounds, the furniture and the cursors must be their exact size, a sheet the same shape, and a cat's
frames must split its width. A 9-slice drawn at another size than the pack's needs its border, and a cat
its frames when they aren't square: say so in art/skin.json ("slice": [top, right, bottom, left],
"frames": 6, "secs": 0.6; a paw its tip, "hot": [x, y]), which this keeps on every run. Entries for files that have
gone are dropped; one pointed by hand at art elsewhere under art/ (another pack's) is kept while its file is there.

The rest of the design system is tokens, kept here in two modes, as Figma keeps a variable per mode:
"tokens": {"--ink": "#3F2A20", "--px-size": "16px"} for light and "dark": {...} for what differs at night (TOKENS in
the page lists them: colours as six hex digits, sizes in px or rem). Drop a design tokens file in art/skin/ too (the
W3C format Figma's variables export, or The look's own export: *.tokens.json, "dark" in its name for the dark mode)
and its tokens are read into that mode; a token is matched by its own name (ink, go, px-size...) wherever it sits,
and one the same as it would be anyway (the cafe's own in light, light's in dark) is left out, as The look does.
A mode with a tokens file in art/skin/ is rebuilt from its files alone on every run, so a token taken out of the file
goes; a mode with no file keeps the tokens written in skin.json by hand. A drawing's settings (its border, frames...)
are kept while it stays the size they were given for ("w" and "h" in its entry); redrawn at another size, they go,
and this says so.

The page also takes art from The look in its House menu; that wins over this file. Needs nothing but Python.
