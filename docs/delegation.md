# Delegating the easy work to smaller models

**Status (5 October 2026, evening): delegate first, on facts only.** Her word: "Make sure this never happens again.
Always run the delegation before assigning anything to anyone." A workflow had sent 58 agents out on the session's
Opus, because `right_sized` read only `Task` and `Agent` and only spoke about an unnamed spawn. Now every assignment
names its model on the call, whatever the session runs and whether or not she has capped the repo: a spawn, each
`agent()` call in a `Workflow` script, and `create_session`. One that names none, or a model off the ladder, is
refused, and the block says how to choose (the table below, or the decider's `preset: easy`). A fork keeps its
parent's. A workflow's `agent()` defaults to the session's model, exactly as Explore does (step 0 below), so naming
the model on each call is the only way to choose it.

Her cap stays hers: `tiers.ceiling` in a repo's `.claude/catio-rules.json` caps its sub agents, a model named above it
is refused (and so is every sub agent while `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE`, which overrides the call, is above
it), and a cap written in a shape the rule can't use, a typo'd key or a ceiling outside the block, is said rather than
silently doing nothing. There is no house ceiling (`harness/README.md`, "Delegate first: spend what the task is
worth").

Two things it deliberately does **not** do, both built, reviewed and taken out (#112) because they were wrong in both
directions. It does not judge whether a task is easy from the prompt's words: that is the `decide` rubric below, and
the errand ceiling that read prompts is gone. And it does not work out what an unnamed spawn would resolve to: Claude
Code decides that from `_FORCE`, the call, the agent's file, `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` and the session, and a hook
reimplementing that chain waved spawns past the cap when it guessed low and refused Haiku-pinned helpers when it
guessed high. It reads no agent files, so the scout and the tester, Haiku in theirs, are spawned with
`model: "haiku"` on the call, and graphify's extraction agents with `model="haiku"`. The model on the call is the one
fact a hook can see, and the one thing a session can always provide.

**Status (3 October 2026, evening): phase A is built** (`harness/agents/scout.md` and `tester.md`, the soft rule
`delegate`, its nudge in `graph_first.py`, the edit gate in `gates.py`), waiting for her merge with the rest of `harness/`.
The agents live in the house-rules plugin (`harness/agents/`) rather than `catio-plugin/agents/`, since the house rules
are the plugin every session of hers loads. Phase B is next; C after. The plan, cheapest step first, each one useful on its own.

## What exists today

- **A breed per room.** `rooms/<k>.model` is the model a New cat gets in that room (`MODELS` in the page: Fable 5.1,
  Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5, Haiku 4.5; Opus by default). Charlotte picks it per room, or per cat, in the New cat form.
  Nothing picks it for her.
- **The merge gate knows who worked.** `models()` in `harness/hooks/common.py` reads every model that answered in a
  session, and the merging rule (`rules.json`, `merging.strong`: opus, fable) merges only when a strong one did. A
  Sonnet or Haiku cat's pull request is **held for her**, with a note in the litter box. A subagent's sidechain
  doesn't count: a strong session that sends a Haiku helper to search or run tests still merges.
- **The queen can't start anything.** Her runner is `claude -p --restricted --allowedTools mcp__catio`, with no file
  tools and no `create_session`. Her brief says so: starting a session is "what only claude.ai can do".
- **Claude Code already delegates**, inside a session: the `Agent` tool takes `model: haiku | sonnet`, and
  `.claude/agents/*.md` can pin a model and a tool list. The graphify skill uses it for extraction. No house rule
  asks sessions to use it, and no agent definition in `catio-plugin/` does.
- **The sorter** (the brain's `route()`) is the one place a small model is used on purpose, and only to file files.

So the ingredients are there. What's missing is a rule saying when, a way for the queen to start small cats, and a
rubric for "easy".

## What counts as easy

A task goes to a smaller model when all of these hold. The queen's brief and the house rule carry the same list.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Spelled out** | the ask names the file, the test or the output; no design judgment, no "make it better" |
| **Checkable** | a test, a build or a diff shows whether it is done |
| **Small** | one file, or read-only across many |
| **Not held** | nothing under `harness/`, `.claude/`, the merging rule's `hold` paths, or a public repo's rules |
| **Not private** | none of her legal, money or health matters (the `private` rule) |
| **No browser** | no preflight needed |

Haiku: read, search, run and report (a test run and its failures in three lines; a summary of a doc; a graphify
extraction; alt text from a filename list). Sonnet: a one-file fix with a test that shows it, a docstring pass, a
rename across a package. Everything else stays Opus or Fable, and the merge gate stays as it is: **a small model's
pull request is always hers to merge.** That is the safety net, and it is already built.

## Phase A: inside a session (no new infrastructure)

A strong session hands its mechanical steps to a small sub agent. Half a day. Reviewed on 3 October against the
open-source tools that do this (below); the review changed it in four places, marked *changed*.

0. **The one-line version first** (*changed*). Claude Code resolves a sub agent's model from the call, then the
   agent file, then `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`, then the session's model, and the built-in Explore and
   general-purpose agents run on the **session's** model by default, so today every Explore in her Opus session
   costs Opus. Setting `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=haiku` in her Claude environments puts every unpinned sub agent on
   Haiku with no file in the repo. Try that for a week before anything below: it also moves graphify's extraction
   sub agents to Haiku, so watch the map's quality; if it drops, pin graphify's agents to `sonnet` and keep the
   variable. (Superseded on 5 October: every assignment now names its model on the call, which beats the variable,
   and graphify's skill names `model="haiku"`, or `"sonnet"` if the map's quality drops.)
1. **Two agent definitions** in `catio-plugin/agents/`, each with `model`, `tools`, `maxTurns` and `omitClaudeMd:
   true` in its frontmatter (the built-in Explore skips CLAUDE.md for the same reason; hers is long):
   - `scout` (haiku): Glob, Grep, Read, and the graphify query preloaded with `skills:`. Finds where things are and
     reports paths and lines, nothing else.
   - `tester` (haiku): Bash, Read. Runs the repo's checks and reports what failed, with the failing lines.

   No `scribe` (*changed*): a PR description or a changelog line needs the diff the parent already holds, and a sub
   agent that must be handed that context costs more than it saves. Anthropic's own finding is that splitting by
   job title (planning, implementing, testing, reviewing) spent more on coordination than on the work; what pays is
   splitting along information boundaries: a self-contained job with verbose output and a short answer. Scout and
   tester are that. Prose stays with the parent, in Sonnet's or Opus's hands, where the French is better anyway.

   Neither gets Edit or Write. A small model that only reads, runs and reports can't weaken "a strong model did the
   work", so the merge gate's promise holds without a new rule.
2. **A nudge, not only a rule** (*changed*). The soft rule `delegate` goes in `harness/rules.json` ("Send the small
   stuff to a smaller cat"), with its switch on the page like the other soft rules. But the tools that work don't
   rely on prose: cc-router's scout guard watches the main session for an unbounded search and suggests the Scout,
   twice a session, then stays quiet. `graph_first.py` already does exactly this shape for the map; the same hook
   gets a second line: a `Grep` or `Glob` across the repo, or a `Bash` test run, in the main session on a strong
   model, is answered once with "scout/tester would do this for a tenth of the price". No block.
3. **The gate check moves to the moment of the edit** (*changed*). The plan said: refuse a commit when a small
   sidechain touched a tracked file, read from the transcript. Two facts against it: sub agent transcripts live
   in their own files (`subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`), not in the sidechain entries `models()` reads, and hooks run
   *inside* sub agents, with the agent's name as `agent_type`. So `gates.py` refuses `Edit`, `Write` and
   `NotebookEdit` when `agent_type` is `scout` or `tester`, or when the running model is not strong and the file is
   tracked. Belt and braces over the frontmatter allowlist, a few lines, and it fires before anything is written
   instead of at the commit. A test beside the "sonnet worked on it" one.
4. **Escalation is "do it yourself"**. claude-router escalates a failed Sonnet job to Opus with the error attached;
   oh-my-opencode keeps `explore` and `explore-medium` on two sizes. Neither for the café: when scout or tester
   comes back empty or wrong, the rule says the session does that step itself, once. No bigger scout, no retry
   loop.

Done when: a session in this repo runs `tester` on Haiku and merges its own PR; `sh catio/test/run.sh` and the
harness tests pass unchanged.

**Later, from the same review, if A earns it:**
- An `implementer` on Sonnet that may edit code, the way every other tool allows (cc-router's Worker,
  claude-router's Implementer, oh-my-opencode's executor; aider's architect/editor split is the same idea and set
  records on its own benchmark). In the café the gate would then count its sidechain as Sonnet work, so its PRs are
  held for her, which is the right default. Not in A: the point of A is that nothing small writes code.
- cc-router's **quota step-down**: at 85 % of her plan's window, every tier drops one (strong stays strong for
  merging, which the gate wants anyway). Needs the usage reading from the status line; later.

### Reviewed against

- Claude Code's sub agent reference: the frontmatter (`model` incl. `fable`, `tools`, `disallowedTools`,
  `maxTurns`, `omitClaudeMd`, `skills`, `memory`, `background`, `isolation: worktree`), the model resolution order,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` and `_FORCE`, Explore and general-purpose on the session's model by default, hooks
  running inside sub agents, separate transcript files, and "use a sub agent when the output is verbose, the work is
  self-contained and returns a summary".
- **cc-router** (theBlackEndDev): Scout and Scribe on Haiku, Worker, Researcher, Reviewer and Planner on Sonnet,
  Plan on Opus; the tier comes from which helper is started, enforced by hooks at `SubagentStart`; "no upgrades";
  the scout guard; quota step-down at 85 %. No measured savings published.
- **claude-router** (vimoxshah): Explorer on Haiku, Implementer on Sonnet, Hard-implementer and Reviewer on Opus,
  Advisor on Fable; "cheap models for volume, premium where a mistake compounds"; only the two implementers write;
  escalation with error context; a validation script before dispatch. No measured results.
- **wshobson/agents**: four tiers over about two hundred agents: Opus for architecture, security, all review and
  production code; Sonnet for docs, testing and debugging; Haiku for operational chores and simple docs. Note that
  it puts testing on Sonnet: that is writing tests; running them is Haiku work.
- **oh-my-opencode / oh-my-claudecode**: explore and librarian on the cheapest models "because they do not need
  deep reasoning", oracle on the strongest "because its outputs gate execution", three sizes of executor.
- **aider's architect/editor mode**: a strong model plans, a cheap one edits; state of the art on its own
  benchmark. The opposite split from A, and the argument for the later `implementer`.
- **RouteLLM** (LMSYS): a learned router between a cheap and a strong model, 85 % cost cut at 95 % of quality on
  MT-Bench. Overkill here: in Claude Code the session itself is the router, by which helper it starts.
- **Anthropic on multi-agent systems**: Opus lead with Sonnet sub agents beat a single Opus by 90 % on its research
  eval; divide by information boundary, not by job title; isolate a subtask when it produces over about a thousand
  tokens of which little matters to the parent; write the sub agent a precise objective, output format and
  boundaries.

## Phase B: the queen starts small cats

"Agents the gateway runs itself" (plan, phase 5, later). The runner on her PC already runs `claude`; it can run a
worker too. A day or two.

1. **A `delegate` tool** on the gateway and in `catio_mcp.py` (same name, arguments, result in both): `repo`,
   `task`, `model` (`haiku` or `sonnet`, nothing bigger: a strong cat is started in claude.ai, by her), `room`.
   Only the queen's key and Charlotte may call it. It writes `jobs/<id>` (`status: queued`) and wakes a waiting
   runner.
2. **The runner picks jobs up** from `/api/runner/wait` beside her notes and routines, and runs
   `claude -p --model <model> --max-turns N` in `~/.catio/work/<repo>` (cloned or fetched first), **with**
   `CATIO_URL` and `CATIO_TOKEN` in the environment this time, so the worker reports itself as a cat through
   `report.py`, lands in `room`, and its `said` comes back to the queen as a handoff. One job at a time, the queen's
   own turns first. The job's `status` goes `running`, then `done` or `failed` with the last lines.
3. **The queen's brief** (`queen.md`) gets the rubric above and the tool: when Charlotte says "have a small cat do
   X", or a cat's `ask` is something a Haiku can answer by reading the repo, she delegates and says so in a line.
   She never delegates a held path or a private matter, and she never delegates when the rubric doesn't hold: she
   tells Charlotte to start a cat in claude.ai instead.
4. **On the page**, a delegated cat is a cat like any other (`via: runner`, breed Haiku or Sonnet), and the
   queen's menu says "N small cats working". Nothing drawn on the sprite.

Done when: she tells the queen "have a small cat run the grocery app's tests", a Haiku cat appears in the kitchen,
reports, and its line lands in the queen's thread; `harness/test/test_queen.py` runs a job against the fake
`claude` and the stand-in gateway.

## Phase C: automatic

With B in place, delegation needs no asking. Small steps, each a few hours.

0. **The model on every call, and her cap as the memory.** Built, 5 October, before B, since it rides the spawn a
   session was already making. The `right_sized` rule, `hooks/right_sized.py` and `rules.json`'s `tiers`. What it
   adds over the `delegate` nudge: `delegate` suggests a smaller cat for two named jobs (a whole-repo search, a test
   run); this reads *every* assignment, refuses one that names no model on the call (her "always run the
   delegation"), and keeps her cap where she has set one. What it does not do: pick the model itself, judge a task,
   or resolve a model it cannot see. The session picks, by the table above or the decider's `preset: easy` (phase D,
   which needs a server); the hook stays offline and checks only what the call says.

1. **Routines on a small model.** `routines/<id>.model`, a select in her Routines card (Fable off the list), and
   `--model` in the runner's turn. Most routines are easy by nature (a morning report, a test run): the cheapest
   win, and it needs no job queue, so it can ship before B.
2. **The queen triages asks.** Each `refreshAgents` cycle she already sees every `needs` cat. A new line in her
   brief: when an `ask` passes the rubric (a fact about the repo, a test to run), delegate it to a scout and post
   the answer to the cat as a comment from the queen, instead of setting Charlotte homework. Homework stays for
   choices only she can make.
3. **A Chores room.** A room with `model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` and a blurb that says what goes there. New
   cats she starts there are Haiku already; a delegated cat's `room` defaults to it.
4. **The brain's tray.** A file dropped with a note that reads like a task ("summarise this", "check these
   against the catalogue") is offered to the queen for delegation, with her confirmation, not before.

## Phase D: the yes/no decisions on a System One model (Jev, or an open twin)

Her ask (3 October): save tokens by running Jev locally, "even if that means giving Jev decisions that require only
probability outcomes". Researched the same day; the sources are at the end.

**What Jev is.** TypeSafe AI's System One model (early access 15 September 2026). It writes no text: it takes a
*state* (any text or JSON) and a schema of typed *questions*, and returns a probability for every allowed answer, in
one parallel pass, in 70 to 500 ms. Three question types: `noul` (yes/no, the probability of yes), `choice` (one of
up to 255 options, a probability each and a confidence), `score` (an ordered rubric, a probability-weighted score).
Price: $0.042 per million input tokens, output free, because there is no output to speak of. It is not the "stage
one" of Claude Code's own permission classifier (a fast yes/no filter tuned to err toward blocking, with a reasoning
pass behind it): that is Anthropic's, inside auto mode, and not something the café can call. Same shape of idea,
though, and that shape is what the café can use.

**Can it run locally? Jev itself, no.** It is a closed, hosted API; nothing to download. Four ways round it, in order
of fit for the café:

1. **Jev itself, or Clef, through the gateway's own Worker.** Both are in Cloudflare's model catalogue and both
   answer to the same `env.AI` binding with the same System One request (`state`, `questions` of `noul`, `choice`
   and `score`), so **the model id is the only switch**:
   - `typesafe/jev` (the page she found): Jev as a third-party model, zero data retention, 32K tokens of state,
     $0.042 per million input tokens, output and cached input free. Third-party models are paid from prepaid AI
     Gateway credits (unified billing, a 5 % fee on the top-up, the provider's own rate otherwise), not from the
     free neurons. At a few hundred tokens a decision, a $5 top-up is tens of thousands of decisions.
   - `@cf/cloudflare/clef-flash` (9B) and `@cf/cloudflare/clef` (27B): Cloudflare's own decision models, released
     1 October 2026, Jev-compatible, weights Apache 2.0 on Hugging Face, 64K tokens of state, up to 64 questions a
     call, Clef-flash 13× faster than Jev at the median on Cloudflare's runs. These are Workers AI models, so they
     run on the **free plan's 10,000 neurons a day** and cost $0.09 per million input tokens past that.

   The integration is an `ai` binding in `wrangler.jsonc` and one `env.AI.run(model, { state, questions })`.
   Jev's reply, as the page shows it: `answers.<q>.noul` (a probability), `answers.<q>.choice` with `confidence`
   and `probabilities` per option, `answers.<q>.score` with a `legend` and `probabilities` per level, plus
   `usage.input_tokens`. Not her PC, but her own account, no new vendor account, no key in the repo, no process to
   keep running, and deployed by the same merge as everything else. Start on Clef-flash (free); switch the string
   to `typesafe/jev` for a decision where Jev's calibration is worth paying for.
2. **Laya on her PC** (ConvAI Innovations, Apache 2.0): the open model that tops JevBench's open entries. `pip install
   laya`; ONNX Runtime on CPU, CUDA or Apple Silicon; three checkpoints of 322M to 421M parameters, well under a
   gigabyte; a multilingual one (French included) with up to 8,192 tokens of state. `laya-serve` speaks Jev's
   `POST /v1/systemone`, so anything written for Jev or Clef points at `localhost` unchanged. Published numbers: 33 to
   40 ms a question on a T4, 7 ms each in a batch; typed-decision accuracy 0.766 against Jev's 0.727; calibration
   error 0.081 against 0.246. Caveats from its own README: over-confident as shipped (run
   `fit_abstention_thresholds()` on real decisions before trusting a confidence gate), option order biases answers,
   and options share a token budget of about 200, so twenty short options, not 255. Truly local, truly free, and the
   runner (`queen.py`) and the hooks on her PC are the natural callers.
3. **Jevstiller** (Apache 2.0): a proxy in front of Jev that learns a tiny local model (a sentence encoder and a
   logistic regression) from Jev's own answers, and takes over the confident share at about 16 ms on a CPU, with a
   2 % audit slice still going to Jev and a Clopper-Pearson bound on the agreement you set (98 % by default). It
   needs about 5,000 answers of one repeated question before it carries most of the load. The café will not make
   5,000 of any one decision for a long while: not for us yet.
4. **jev-local** (MIT): mimics Jev with a 7B chat model on Ollama or llama.cpp, JSON-parsed, 200 to 800 ms on a GPU
   and 3 to 10 s on a CPU, no measured accuracy. A chat model pretending to be a decision model: not recommended.

**What the documentation says about token efficiency.** The claim, consistently, is not that Jev is a cheaper
LLM but that it removes LLM calls whose answer was always one bit or one label:

- TypeSafe: input at $0.042 per million, output free, 70 to 500 ms; one call carries many questions, "evaluated
  independently against the same state, so batching is nearly free" (jev-harness).
- A Claude Code permission gate on Jev measured over 90 live decisions: 264 ms median against about 4 s for an
  LLM judge, $0.0000227 a decision against about $0.0022 on a frontier model (99 % lower), and zero Claude quota
  used. The same README warns that adding Jev *on top of* an existing fast path only adds its 264 ms.
- The Jev model routers for Claude Code (half a dozen on GitHub, all the same shape) send about 400 tokens per
  sub agent spawn, ask four to six `noul` questions ("root-cause investigation?", "architecture decision?",
  "mechanical edit with a named target?", "scope stated?"), weight them into a score, and pick Haiku, Sonnet or
  Opus. They route **only sub agents**, never the main conversation, because switching the main model invalidates
  its prompt cache, which costs more than the routing saves. They cap a read-only sub agent at the cheap tier before
  asking anything, demand a higher margin before downgrading one that can edit, and fail open to a tier you set.
- Cloudflare on Clef: "no free-form output to parse and no reasoning tokens to wait for".

**Where the café has decisions that are only probabilities.** Each is a Claude turn today, or a keyword score, or
Charlotte:

| Decision today | Who makes it | As System One questions |
|---|---|---|
| Is this task easy? (the rubric above) | the queen's Opus turn, or Charlotte | six `noul`: spelled out, checkable, one file, touches a held path, private, needs a browser; the router pattern |
| Which model for a new cat | `rooms/<k>.model`, by hand | `choice` over Haiku, Sonnet, Opus, from the task text |
| Where a dropped file goes (the brain's `route()`) | keyword score, then a chat model as sorter | `choice` over the open rooms and the cats with a brief; Clef reads images too, so a screenshot sorts itself |
| Which cat needs her first (the queen's priority list) | the queen's turn, reading every `ask` | `score` of urgency per cat, batched in one call |
| Is this `said` a handoff she must read now | `refreshAgents` diffs timestamps | `noul` on the note's text |
| Is a tray note a task (phase C4) | nobody | `noul`, with her confirmation after |
| Is this command destructive (the gates) | regex in `gates.py` | keep the regex; a `noul` only as a second gate on what the regex passes, low confidence meaning "ask" |

Not for a System One model: writing anything, the merge itself, "nothing is a guess" (the model's own
self-report; a probability that it was guessing would be guessing twice), and anything under `hold`.

**Built (3 October, this branch): the `decide` tool.** `harness/gateway/src/decide.js` and the House's `decide` tool, the
same tool in `catio_mcp.py` behind `CATIO_DECIDE_URL`, the `AI` binding in `wrangler.jsonc`, the `easy` preset, the
`decisions/` log with `old` and `agree`, and the page's `decideSort()`: in observe mode (the default) the brain asks the
decider the same question it asks the sorter and logs both; `house/main.decide = "on"` lets it sort first above a 0.6
confidence. Tests: the gateway against a stand-in System One server, the MCP server likewise, and the page's e2e for
observe, on and unsure. Not yet: the switch (after a week of the log), the rubric's caller (phase B's queen), and
`decide` in the artifact's stored capabilities (the next republish passes the whole set, CLAUDE.md).
The log was tightened the same evening: the page passes `floor` (agreement counts only the picks "on" would act on),
`ref` (the file's brain id, to check a pick against where she sent it) and no `old` when the sorter didn't answer.

**The step, as planned.** One function, `decide(state, questions)`, in `harness/gateway/src/decide.js`, with two backends behind
one switch: `env.AI` with a model id (`@cf/cloudflare/clef-flash` by default, `typesafe/jev` when wanted; nothing to
install), or `DECIDE_URL` pointing at a System One endpoint such as `laya-serve` on her PC for what runs there (the runner and the hooks call it directly; the Worker
can't reach her PC). The same request body for both, since all three speak the System One API. A confidence floor per
decision; below it, the old path: the strong model, or Charlotte. Start with the two that cost Opus turns today, the
sorter and the easy-task rubric, log every decision beside what the old path would have done for a week (the routers'
"observe mode"), then switch. Add a `decide` tool to `catio_mcp.py` and the gateway, same name and arguments, so the
queen and the cats can ask a one-bit question without spending a turn on it.

Order: after A0 and A1, before B. The rubric is the first thing B needs, and this is how B's queen stops paying Opus
to apply it.

## What never delegates

- Merging, pushing to a default branch, anything under `hold`: the gates refuse these whoever the model is.
- Changes under `harness/` or `.claude/`: the rules themselves.
- Anything needing a browser, or a key.
- Her private matters.
- The queen herself: she stays on the runner's default model. A cheaper queen would be a cheaper assistant.

## Cost, roughly

Haiku is an order of magnitude cheaper than Opus a token, Sonnet a few times cheaper (check the current price list before quoting her a number). A test run, a search or a summary is a
few thousand tokens either way, so phase A pays for itself on the first day of a session that greps a lot. Phase B
spends her PC's time, not money: the runner is signed in with her plan.

## Order

A0, then A1 to A4, then D (Clef on the Worker, the sorter and the rubric first), then C1 (routines on a small model), then B, then C2 to C4. A and C1 need no new secrets, no deploy and
no change to the page's stored capabilities (A0 is one variable in her Claude environments). B changes the gateway (deployed by Workers Builds on merge) and the
runner (she restarts it), so it waits for a quiet day.
