# The camera and the minimap: the plan

Asked for on 30 September 2026: click-and-drag to move around the map, a minimap of the manor in the top-right
corner that folds away, and a camera and controls that feel like The Sims' build mode.

**Where it stands (4 October 2026):** iteration 1, the map panel and the minimap, is built (version 15, phase 1 of
`docs/plan.md`). Iteration 2, the camera, is phase 2 and not built. Live and Build is specified in
`docs/renovation-mode.md`. The plan below was written against version 12 (30 September); "Iterations" records what
was built and where it differs from the plan.

## Where the camera stands in version 12

Version 12 already does a lot of this:

| Already there | How |
|---|---|
| Drag to pan | Left-drag on the house (after 4 px, so a click is still a click); right, middle or Space-drag from anywhere; one finger on touch |
| Zoom around the pointer | Wheel and trackpad pinch (`zoomAt`), two-finger pinch on touch |
| Zoom buttons and keys | `+` `−` `0` and the corner cluster (`#controls`, bottom right) |
| Floors | The floor switch in the same cluster, the stair, Page Up / Page Down |
| The room you're in | `settleFocus()` picks the room that fills the view, and its bubbles speak |
| Limits | `clampCam()` never shows past the meadow; zoom is capped by `limits()` |
| The whole house's menu | The House button (`#houseBtn`), top right |
| Keys | Arrows walk between rooms; Shift+arrows pan; Page Up / Page Down change floor; `+` `−` `0` zoom; Escape backs out; Space-drag pans. No letter keys are taken, and neither is Home on the map |
| Corners | The sign top left, House top right, the floor and zoom cluster bottom right, the credits bottom left |

What it lacks: any sense of where you are once zoomed in, keyboard panning that isn't Shift+arrows, zoom that
lands on crisp pixel sizes, and a quick way to jump across the house. The top-right corner is also taken by the
House button, which is exactly where the minimap is wanted.

## What goes on screen

When this plan is done, there are three things on screen and nothing else:

1. **The sign**, top left. It is unchanged: the tally, plus the warning when something is wrong.
2. **The map panel**, top right. It takes the place of both the House button and the bottom-right cluster:

   ```
   ┌───────────────────────────────┐
   │ [House ▾]  [G | U]       [–]  │  ← header: House menu, floor tabs, fold
   │ ┌───────────────────────────┐ │
   │ │  ▢▢▣▢    ░ catio          │ │  ← the floor as a plan, in the pack's frame
   │ │  ▢[▢▢]▢  ░                │ │     [ ] = what the camera sees
   │ │  ▢▢▢▢•                    │ │     •   = a room where a cat needs you
   │ └───────────────────────────┘ │
   │ [−] [+] [⌂]                   │  ← zoom out, zoom in, whole house
   └───────────────────────────────┘
   ```

   Folded, only the fold button stays (5 October: the whole panel minimises, see "Iterations"). The fold button then carries a pip (the count) when
   a cat that needs Charlotte is off screen or on the other floor.
3. **The mode switch**, bottom left: `Live` / `Build`. It only appears in iteration 3 (below), when build mode
   exists. The credits move back to the bottom right, which the old corner cluster frees up. They stay hidden
   on a phone, as they are now.

Together, that's one fewer cluster of controls than version 12 has, and every control that moves the camera is
in one place.

## The minimap

**What it draws** (decided 30 September): a plan of the current floor's rooms, not a shrunk copy of the
picture. At about 200 px wide the pixel art shrinks to mush. Room boxes read at a glance, and they are the
thing the minimap is for.

- The panel, its frame and its icon buttons come from Game UI Pastel (see "The two UI packs" below).
- Each room is a box from `GEOM[k].r`. It takes one of three flat fills, from the Pastel square buttons'
  faces:
  - a plain fill for an ordinary room;
  - a lighter one for the room under the pointer, on the map or in the house;
  - the green one for the room you're in (`S.focus`).
- The other floor's rooms show faintly underneath, the same way the house fades the ground floor under the
  upper one.
- A room where a cat needs Charlotte gets a small pink pip, and a red one when a cat there is upset. No text
  and no faces: the badge on the room's sign already says the rest.
- The stair is marked (`MANOR.stairs`), and so is the landing upstairs (`MANOR.landing`), so the floors line up
  in your head. Upstairs is only the Library, the bedroom and the bathroom, so the upper plan is mostly
  landing and faded ground floor. That's honest, and fine.
- **The camera's view** is a rounded rectangle: the Pastel panel's border with no fill. It stays the same
  thickness on screen at any zoom.
- The map covers `WORLD`, the whole grounds, so the view rectangle is always inside it. The manor fills most of
  it.

**What it does.**

| On the minimap | Does |
|---|---|
| Click or tap | The camera glides there, at the same zoom |
| Drag the view rectangle, or drag anywhere on the map | The camera pans live, with no glide |
| Double-click a room | Look in (`go(k)`) |
| Wheel | Zooms the camera about the point under the pointer on the map |
| Hover a room | Names it in the tip line, as hovering in the house does |
| `G` / `U` tabs | Change floor (`setFloor`) |
| Fold button, or `M` | Folds or unfolds the panel |

**Cost.** The rooms are redrawn in `render()`, which already runs on every data change. The view rectangle is
one element moved by `transform` from inside `setCam()`, so dragging the house stays smooth.

**Remembered.** Folded or open is kept in `localStorage` as `catio.minimap`, wrapped in `try`. It's a
per-viewer convenience, like `catio.sound`. It starts open on a laptop and folded on a phone (560 px wide or
less), where the house is small enough already.

**Menus keep clear of it.** `showMenu()` and the hover tip must treat the panel's box as off limits, the same
way they already keep inside the stage. Otherwise a room menu on the right-hand side opens underneath it.

**Accessibility.**
- The minimap is a faster way to do what the keyboard can already do (arrows between rooms, Enter, Look in,
  Page Up / Page Down), so its drawing is `aria-hidden`.
- The fold button has `aria-expanded`, and the floor tabs are real buttons with `aria-pressed`.
- Dragging the view has a single-click alternative (click to jump), which WCAG 2.5.7 asks for.

## The camera, in the manner of The Sims' build mode

The Sims' build camera feels good for four reasons, and each has an equivalent here:

1. **You can move without touching the mouse** (decided 30 September): WASD and the arrow keys both pan.
   - Holding a key keeps the view moving, a little faster the longer it's held, smoothed on
     `requestAnimationFrame`.
   - Two keys held together go diagonally, and W and ↑ (and so on) are the same key.
   - Moving the view closes an open menu and the tip, as dragging does.

   The arrows have a second job they must keep: for someone using only the keyboard, the map is one Tab stop and
   the arrows walk from room to room (`arrows()`, the tested keyboard map). They do one or the other:

   | Where focus is | Arrow keys | Shift+arrows | WASD |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Nowhere, or on the house after a mouse click or a tap | Pan | Pan | Pan |
   | On a room, arrived at by Tab, an arrow or Escape from its menu | Walk to the room next door; the camera glides after it when that room is partly off screen | Pan | Pan |
   | In a menu, a field, a dialog or a select | Left to that control | Left to that control | Typing |

   How the page tells which: a `keyNav` flag, set when a room takes focus straight after a keydown, and
   cleared on any pointerdown. Don't use `:focus-visible` at the moment of the keypress, because browsers
   don't agree on it after a mouse click. So a mouse user who clicks a room and presses → pans, and a
   keyboard user who tabs onto the map walks the rooms, exactly as the e2e test expects now.
2. **Zoom lands on steps.** The + and − buttons, `Z` / `X` and the keys step through fixed levels: the whole
   house, one floor, then one art pixel as 1, 2, 3 and 4 screen pixels. Wheel and pinch stay smooth. About
   180 ms after they stop, the camera eases to the nearest step when it is close to one (within about 12%).
   Pixel art only looks sharp at whole-number sizes, so this also stops the shimmer that fractional zoom leaves
   on the furniture.
3. **Releasing a drag carries on a little.** A flick keeps gliding briefly and slows to a stop. There is no
   glide with reduced motion, and never past `clampCam()`'s edges.
4. **You can jump.**
   - `F` frames the thing whose menu is open: a cat, a room or a queen.
   - `Home` or `0` goes to the whole house.
   - Double-clicking a room looks in.
   - The minimap jumps anywhere.

Optional, both **off** by default, each with a switch in the House menu:

- **Edge scroll:** holding the pointer at the edge of the screen pans that way. It's off because the menus and
  the map panel live at the edges.
- **Saved views,** as The Sims has: `Ctrl+1`…`Ctrl+5` saves the camera and floor, and `1`…`5` goes back to it.
  They're kept in `localStorage` as `catio.views`.

**Letter keys.**
- WASD, Z, X, F and M only act when focus is on the house or the page: never in a field, a dialog or a menu.
- There's a "Keyboard shortcuts" switch in the House menu to turn them off. WCAG 2.1.4 asks for a way to turn
  off single-key shortcuts. The arrows aren't character keys, so they keep working when the switch is off.
- Pressing `?` lists the keys in the tip line.
- `#keyhelp`, the text a screen reader hears on a room, gains "WASD or the arrows move the view when no room
  is selected".

**No rotation.** In The Sims, "orientation" means turning the camera. This map can't turn. Every piece of the
art is drawn from one side:
- back walls face north;
- shadows fall one way;
- doors and windows have fixed faces.

Turned 90°, the walls would show their tops and the furniture would lie on its side. North stays up. The
minimap is what keeps you oriented instead.

## Live and Build

The Sims splits play from building, and so does the KittyChat Cafe. Live is the page as it is. Build is
**renovation mode**: moving the furniture, adding and removing the decorative pieces, and choosing each
filing cabinet's look. Its full spec moved to **`docs/renovation-mode.md`** on 1 October 2026; it is phase 3
of `docs/plan.md`, after the camera here.

## The two UI packs

Charlotte decided on 30 September that `Game_UI_Pack_Pastel.zip`, from her Drive folder "KittyChat Cafe
Assets", goes in alongside Sprout Lands. She attached it that day, and this section records what is in it.

**What it is.** *Game UI Pack — Pastel Edition*, by **SC_siosio**, from itch.io. It holds:
- about 1,300 pieces, each as a PNG and an SVG;
- square, rectangular and circular buttons in Normal, Hovered and Clicked states;
- panels (square, rectangular, horizontal and vertical), each in Light (white face) and Dark (navy face);
- icons: arrows, reload, plus, minus, times, divide, equals, play, pause, skip, volume, a music note, check,
  star, heart, dollar, settings, options, slider, question, exclamation, lock, unlock and prohibited;
- ribbons and a round slider knob;
- 16 pastel colours.

It is smooth vector art, drawn at 500 to 1000 px, with rounded corners and a darker shadow at the bottom
edge. It is not pixel art.

Quirks found on opening it:
- **The icons' and panels' colour names run backwards against the buttons'.** The icon or panel named
  "Indigo" is amber, "Red" is pink, "Apple Green" is cyan, and so on: name *n* of the 16 has the colour of
  button 17 − *n*. `build-art.py` must pick by that reversed name, and say so in a comment.
- The Outline panel folders are empty, and so is `Icons/System/Interrogation`. Use the Filled panels and the
  `Question` icon.
- There is no house, map or grid icon, and no selection outline.

**Who does what.** Each surface is drawn from one pack only, never a mix of both inside one panel:

| Sprout Lands UI (unchanged) | Game UI Pastel |
|---|---|
| Room, cat and queen menus; dialogs; speech bubbles; the sign; the room brackets; the mood faces; the crown and stars; the paw pointer; the pixel font | The map panel and the camera's controls; in Build: the switch, the catalogue bar, the cabinet's "Looks like…" panel, undo and redo |

The split follows the kind of thing:
- what talks about the cats and rooms stays Sprout Lands;
- what works the camera, and what builds the house, comes from Game UI Pastel.

The switches inside the House menu stay Sprout Lands' toggle, because the House menu is a Sprout menu. Its
labels keep the pixel font, which is lettering, not a panel.

**The pieces, role by role:**

| Role | Game UI Pastel piece |
|---|---|
| The map panel | Horizontal panel as a 9-slice: **Light** in the light theme and **Dark** in the dark one, which matches the page's own themes. Its white face is recoloured to the page's cream, which the licence allows. Its border is the amber one (the file named `Indigo`) |
| The view rectangle on the minimap | The same panel's border with no fill: a rounded outline in the pack's own line. This replaces the Sprout brackets the first draft suggested |
| Minimap rooms | Flat fills from the square buttons' faces: Amber for a room, Amber Hovered for the room under the pointer, Apple Green for the room you're in |
| The pips on the minimap | Pink for a room where a cat needs Charlotte, Red for one where a cat is upset |
| Zoom in and zoom out | Square buttons, Amber, in Normal, Hovered and Clicked, with the `Plus` and `Minus` icons |
| Whole house | The same button, with the page's own small house glyph (the pack has no house icon) |
| Floor tabs | Rectangle buttons, Amber, with Clicked for the floor you're on, labelled "Ground" and "Upstairs" in the pixel font. The pink `Arrow_Down` / `Arrow_Up` pip shows when a cat on that floor needs Charlotte |
| Fold and unfold | The square button, with the page's own pixel glyphs: an arrow into the panel's corner while it is open, a folded map once it is minimised. `Arrow_Up` / `Arrow_Down` read as the floors beside the floor tabs, so they went on 5 October |
| House | A Rectangle button, Amber, labelled "House". It opens the House menu, which is still Sprout Lands |
| The `?` key list | The `Question` icon on a circle button |
| Live / Build switch | A Rectangle button as the track and the round slider knob (Light) sliding across it. The knob goes to the left for Live and to the right for Build |
| Build's title | A Ribbon, Apple Green, saying "Build" at the top centre while Build is on |
| The catalogue bar | A Horizontal panel along the bottom. Its tabs are Rectangle buttons, one colour per kind of room |
| Undo and redo | Circle buttons with `Reload`: as drawn for redo, mirrored for undo |
| A filing cabinet that can't leave its room | The `Lock` icon on the piece while it's dragged outside |

**Scale.** The pack is smooth art, so it's scaled down with ordinary smoothing, never `pixelated`.
`build-art.py` renders each piece at exactly the size the page uses, at 1× and 2× for sharp screens, so the
browser never shrinks a 500 px image. At those sizes the pieces are small, and the reverse-named colours
match the Sprout tans, greens and pinks closely.

**Getting it into a session.** The zip was attached on 30 September. Chat uploads last only as long as their
session, so a later session needs it attached again, since the Drive connector can't hand over 12.5 MB. Then:
- `build-art.py` takes it as one more zip (the interface alone can be rebuilt from Sprout Lands and it);
- it cuts only the pieces the page uses into `art/licensed/pastel/`: `panel`, `panel-dark`, `frame`,
  `button`, `button-hover`, `button-down` and an `icons` strip. They're separate files because a 9-slice
  `border-image` can't be cut out of an atlas. Each is drawn at twice its size on screen, and resized and
  recoloured, never the pack's own files;
- `bundle.py` and the publish `files` list pick them up;
- `run.sh`'s no-art copy leaves them out, and every Pastel surface keeps a plain colour underneath, as the
  Sprout pieces do.

**Licence.** It's in `LICENSE.txt` in the zip, and it's recorded in CLAUDE.md and `catio/art/CREDITS.md`.

It allows:
- use in websites, personal or commercial;
- resizing, recolouring and combining the pieces.

It requires:
- the credit **"Game UI Pack created by SC_siosio"**, readable, in the footer.

It forbids:
- redistributing the files, modified or not;
- uploading them to a repository;
- leaving the original or modified files easy to extract from the finished work.

So:
- never commit it (it lives under `art/licensed/`, which is gitignored);
- publish only those cut pieces, never the pack's own PNG or SVG files;
- keep it to the private artifact and her own localhost copy.

**Rules updated.** CLAUDE.md now has the second pack's rule, its licence, and a `layouts` row with the
cabinet's look (30 September). `docs/from-the-litterbox.md` (from the old loose ends) and `docs/plan.md` still say the pack stays out:
change them when the manor branch is merged.

## Iterations

Each iteration ends with the e2e test green, screenshots at 1440×900 and 390×844 in light and dark, and one
commit. Only then does the next start.

**1. The map panel and the minimap**: built 30 September. e2e: 143 passed. Where it differs from the plan
above:
- the zoom buttons sit in the header row beside House and the fold, and the floor tabs sit under the minimap;
- the minimap shows the manor and catio (`MM.box`), not the whole grounds, so the rooms read larger;
- the view frame is the Pastel panel's border, recoloured in the page's ink so it shows on the amber rooms;
- on a phone the panel sits bottom right (the sign fills the top), and starts folded;
- the House menu opens to the left of the panel;
- `M` works now; the shortcuts switch that can turn it off comes with iteration 2.
- merged with version 13 (the KittyChat Cafe) before publishing: House is the brand, top left, as that version
  made it, so the panel holds zoom, the fold, the minimap and the floors. Version 13's pixelated Pastel icons stay
  everywhere else (a cat's actions, the house rules' lock); the panel keeps its smooth pieces.

- Cut the Game UI Pastel pieces listed above with `build-art.py` (attach the zip again if this is a new
  session), and add "Game UI Pack created by SC_siosio" to the footer.
- Merge the House button, the floor switch and the zoom buttons into the panel, and draw the minimap.
- Add click-to-jump, drag-the-view, double-click to look in, fold, and `M`.
- Keep menus clear of the panel.
- *Checks:*
  - the view rectangle matches the camera after a drag, a wheel zoom and Look in;
  - a click on the minimap moves the camera there;
  - folding is remembered across a reload;
  - the phone starts folded;
  - a room menu on the right never opens under the panel;
  - the no-art copy still draws the panel and its buttons on plain colour;
  - the footer credits SC_siosio;
  - the whole house's actions (the brain, house rules, Edit rooms, sound, the attic) are still reachable
    from House in the panel.

**1b. Minimising the panel**: 5 October, her ask: "allow the mini-map to be minimizable". The fold used to hide
only the plan, leaving the zoom row and the floor tabs up (on a phone, two rows of buttons over a small screen),
and its up and down arrows sat beside "Ground" and "Upstairs", where they read as the floors. Now:
- folding minimises the whole panel to the fold button, in the corner the panel is anchored to, so it doesn't
  move; wheel, pinch, the keys, the stair and Page Up / Page Down still do what the hidden buttons did;
- minimised, the button carries one pip for every cat that needs her out of view: off screen on this floor, or
  anywhere on the other one, which the hidden floor tab would have shown;
- its glyphs are the page's own pixel drawings, like the whole house's: an arrow into the corner (flipped to the
  bottom right on a phone) and a folded map. They are the slot `map-fold` (two cells, 20 × 8), drawn in code until
  she draws it, as `owner` is; `map-icons`' up and down cells are no longer drawn;
- on a phone the zoom row sits at the panel's foot, under her thumb, and the fold stays in the bottom right corner.
- *Checks:* minimised, the zoom and floor buttons are hidden and the panel is one button in the same corner; going
  upstairs while minimised puts the hidden ground floor's pip on the button and says so in its name; on a phone,
  opened, the fold is in the bottom right corner.

**2. The camera**
- Add WASD with acceleration, zoom steps with settling, the flick glide, `F`, `Home`, and the shortcuts
  switch.
- *Checks:*
  - holding `D` moves the view right, and stops at the meadow's edge;
  - after a mouse click on the house, holding → pans just like `D`;
  - after Tab onto the map, → moves the ring to the room next door (the existing keyboard checks pass
    unchanged), and the camera follows when that room is off screen;
  - Shift+→ pans in both cases;
  - `Z` and `X` land exactly on the steps, and the scale times 2 is a whole number from the first zoom-in step
    upwards;
  - letter keys do nothing inside an input;
  - the shortcuts switch turns the letters off, and the arrows still pan;
  - reduced motion means no glide.

**3. Build mode**: now renovation mode, specified in `docs/renovation-mode.md` with its own four steps and
checks.

The optional edge scroll and saved views come after iteration 2, if Charlotte wants them.

## Decided (Charlotte, 30 September 2026)

1. **The minimap is a plan of rooms**, not a tiny picture.
2. **WASD pans, and so do the arrow keys.** The letters sit behind a shortcuts switch. The arrows still walk
   between rooms for anyone who tabbed onto the map.
3. **Game UI Pastel is used**, for the map panel, the camera's controls and Build's tools. Sprout Lands keeps
   everything else.
4. **A filing cabinet never leaves its room**, but Charlotte chooses what it looks like in each room: any
   floor piece in the catalogue. It keeps its job, its Files and its review spot, whatever it looks like. This
   settles the question left open in `docs/renovation-mode.md`.

Still to come, after iteration 2, if Charlotte wants them: edge scroll and saved views.
