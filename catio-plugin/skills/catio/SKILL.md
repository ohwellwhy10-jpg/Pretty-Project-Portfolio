name: catio
description: Set up or refresh someone's own Catio — a page where every Claude Code session is a cat living in a room of a two-floor pixel-art manor, with a queen who keeps what matters and is the one you talk to. Use this whenever someone wants to see their Claude Code sessions as something other than a list: a dashboard of what's running, what's blocked and what's waiting on them; a "catio", cat café, cat house or session zoo; or when they ask to install, set up, rebuild, refresh or republish the Catio, add a room, or point a room at one of their repositories.

# The Catio

One page where every Claude Code session is a cat. It plays while it works, sleeps when it's done,
and meows when it's waiting on its human: point at it and it says what it needs. Each room of the manor is a kind of
work, and a session's git repository decides which room its cat lives in.

The house also has one **queen**: a cat who is not a session and never leaves. Her seat is the entrance hall's,
or, while that room is closed, wherever new cats come in.
She keeps what matters and is the one you talk to. You give her something to hold, and she hands it back — in
her menu, or said out loud until you take it off her. Talking with her and her routines need her brain running on
the person's own computer (`harness/runner/`) and a gateway, which this skill does not set up: without them her
card still holds what she keeps, and she shows as away.

The page is one private artifact per person. Sessions come live from the Claude Code Remote
connector; rooms, renames, adopted chats and what the queen keeps live in the artifact's own
database, so they follow the person between phone and computer.

## Speak plainly

The person may never have heard of MCP, an API or an LLM. Do not use those words with them. Say it the café's
way: each Claude chat or session is a cat, each project a room, a chat waiting on them is a cat that meows, and
the assistant is the queen. The repository's README has the short version ("In plain words"); use it.
Be straight about where it stands: running your own café works today; a hosted café with nothing to install is
planned and not open yet.

## Say this first: the art is theirs to bring

**The cats are not in the repository and cannot be, and nor is the interface.** Seven of the ten
art packs the page is built from forbid redistributing their files, an eighth is drawn into the same pictures
as theirs, and a ninth came with no licence at all, so `catio/art/licensed/` is gitignored. A fresh clone draws only the Cosy Cabin furniture, its
menus on plain colour: no house and no cats.

Tell the person this before anything else, because it decides whether the rest is worth their time.
The page says it too — the sign reads *"The cat art isn't here"* with the three steps — but hearing
it from a wall of pixels after twenty minutes of setup is a poor way to find out.

What they need, from `catio/art/CREDITS.md`:

| Pack | Artist | Gives |
|---|---|---|
| [Cosy Cabin](https://marie-pepo.itch.io/cosy-cabin) | Marie Pepo | most of the furniture (**already committed**: this one allows it) and, with the others, the manor's floors and walls |
| [Cat Pack Mochi](https://toffeecraft.itch.io/cat-pack) + [Pochi](https://toffeecraft.itch.io/cat-retro), Cat UI | ToffeeCraft | every cat, the logo, the cat tree and the bowls |
| [Top Down Garden Castle](https://heosphorus.itch.io/) | Heosphorus | the meadow, pond, rocks and trees |
| [Wood Garden](https://rowdy41.itch.io/wood-garden) | rowdy41 | the catio decking, fence and gate, bookcases and chests |
| [Pixel Art Top Down – Basic](https://cainos.itch.io/pixel-art-top-down-basic) | Cainos | the stone stair, the arch gate, lanterns and fountain |
| [Sprout Lands UI Pack – Basic](https://cupnooble.itch.io/) | Cup Nooble | the whole interface: panels, buttons, speech bubbles, mood faces, the cat-paw pointer and the pixel font |
| plants.zip | (unknown) | the terrace's plants |
| [Sprout Lands Sprites – Basic](https://cupnooble.itch.io/) | Cup Nooble | flowers on the lawn |
| [Little Dreamyland](https://starmixu.itch.io/little-dreamyland-asset-pack) | Starmixu & Utaskuas | glazed tiles and the spruce forest |
| Game UI Pack – Pastel Edition | SC_siosio | the map panel and the controls' icons. Credit it as "Game UI Pack created by SC_siosio" |

Most have a free tier. Without the ToffeeCraft pack in particular there are no cats, which is most
of the point; without Sprout Lands the menus still work, on plain colour.

**Say plainly where it stands today:** the house and the cats are built from all ten zips at once, in the order
below (in any order, or a folder of them); without `plants.zip` the full build stops. `plants.zip` (the terrace's plants) reached Charlotte with no artist
or licence, so there is no public copy of it yet, and until there is, nobody else can run the full build. What
anyone can build is the interface alone, from the Sprout Lands UI zip (and Game UI Pastel's after it): the café
then works on plain panels, with no house or cats drawn. `CatMegaFree.zip` is the ToffeeCraft row above.

## Setting one up

Work through these with the person. Stop and ask whenever a step needs something only they have.

### 1. Get the page

They press **Fork** on <https://github.com/charredlatte/Pretty-Project-Portfolio> first: their fork is the copy
they change, push to and, for the front desk, import into Cloudflare. Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<their GitHub name>/Pretty-Project-Portfolio
cd Pretty-Project-Portfolio
```

`catio/index.html` is the whole page: no build step, no dependencies. `CLAUDE.md` at the repo
root is the operating brief — read it before changing the page itself.

### 2. Their art

They put their own zips wherever they like, under whatever names, and point the script at the folder.
Neither the names nor the order matters: each zip is recognised by a file only that pack has.

```bash
pip install pillow fonttools
python3 catio/tools/build-art.py ~/Downloads/KittyChat-Cafe-Assets   # or the zips, in any order
```

It prints which zip it took for which pack before it draws anything. Given only the Sprout Lands UI zip
(with or without Game UI Pastel's), it builds just the interface.

That writes `catio/art/licensed/`, which stays gitignored. Never commit what it produces, and never
put it in anything you share — that is the whole reason it is separate.

### 3. Their café, their rooms and their repositories

Ask the same things the page's own wizard asks, in this order, so the page skips it:

1. **The café's name.** Written to `house/main` as `{ "name": "<their name>", "onboarded": <ms since epoch> }`.
   The brand and the browser title read it.
2. **How many rooms, and their names.** The rooms open from the front of the house, public to private:
   `living` (the cat lounge), `dining` (the café), `kitchen`, `study` (the craft room), `sunroom` (the terrace),
   `garden` (the catio), `brain` (the library), `bedroom`, `bath` (the ensuite), `hall`. The first N are open and
   the rest get `"closed": true`: a closed room is dimmed and gets no cats, and opens later under
   Edit rooms. The first open room is where new cats come in (`"catchAll": true`).
3. **Which room each repository goes in.** Call `list_repos` (Claude Code Remote) and ask, repository by
   repository; `repos` takes repository names or `owner/repo`. A repository filed in a closed room is never
   matched, so file them in open rooms.

Then write `house/main` and all ten `rooms/<k>` to their artifact's database with `ArtifactData` (step 5
has the URL), one document per room:

```json
"kitchen": { "name": "Kitchen", "blurb": "Weekly meals", "repos": ["my-recipe-app"], "catchAll": false, "closed": false, "model": "claude-opus-5-5" }
```

`catio/data/rooms.json` is the localhost mirror of those answers (the same ten objects, keyed by room):
keep it in step, `closed` included, so the folder in step 6 opens the same café.

The room keys are fixed by the picture — they are places in a drawing, not a list you can extend.
Downstairs: `dining` (the café), `kitchen`, `living` (the cat lounge), `study` (the craft room), `hall`
(the entrance hall), `sunroom` (the terrace) and `garden` (the catio, outside). Upstairs: `brain` (the
library), `bedroom` and `bath` (the ensuite). Names and
blurbs are theirs to change, here or from the page's own "Edit rooms".

Ask what they actually work on and fill this in with them. A manor where everything lands in the
cat lounge is a worse dashboard than a list.

### 3b. The litter box

`litterbox/` is in their clone: loose Markdown notes go in, and `python3 litterbox/sort.py` piles them by
project and files each pile, once checked, into that project's repository (`HOME` in `sort.py` names another
path than `docs/from-the-litterbox.md`). Pull requests the merging rule holds for them land there too. On the
page the same idea is the brain's tray: a file dropped on the house waits there until it is sorted to a cat.

### 4. Their sessions

The page reads its cats live from Claude Code Remote. It also keeps a saved copy for when that read
is blocked, and that copy is the only source when the page runs off a folder. Do this now, and again whenever they
ask to *save my sessions for the café* (the README tells them to say it):

1. Call `list_sessions` (limit 50) and save the result to a file.
2. `python3 catio/tools/save-sessions.py list_sessions.json` → `catio/data/sessions.json`.
3. Once the page is published (step 5), write that file's object to `snapshot/sessions` in its database with
   `ArtifactData` (`set`). claude.ai refuses the page's own read today, so this copy is where their cats come from.
   Tell them it only changes when they ask a session to save it again.

That output is gitignored, and it should stay that way: it carries their session titles.

### 5. Their page

Publish `catio/index.html` as **their own** private artifact — never republish someone else's.
The URL in this repo's `artifacts.json` is Charlotte's, and her rooms and her queen live in its
database; publishing over it would take her page away from her. Their first publish creates a new
artifact, and they record that URL in their own copy of `artifacts.json`, republishing to it
afterwards with `url` so nothing they have done on the page is lost.

`docs/self-hosting.md` lists Charlotte's values still written into the page and the harness. Change them on their
fork; two of them (`CATIO_URL` in the page, `catio` in `harness/rules.json`) are this artifact's link, which only
exists after the first publish, so set those then and republish to the same URL.

On the first publish it needs these capabilities:

```
capabilities: { mcp: { servers: [{ server: "Claude Code Remote", tools: ["list_sessions", "list_repos", "create_session",
  "set_session_title", "archive_session", "unarchive_session", "interrupt_session"] }] },
  db: {}, assets: {}, sample: {} }
```

Publish the art with it, or the page goes up alone and draws no house: the Artifact tool sends only the HTML
unless every file the page uses is listed in `files`. List `art/furniture.png` and every file under
`art/licensed/` that step 2 wrote (the `.png` files beside it, everything in `ui/`, `sprout.ttf` included, and
everything in `pastel/`), each at its own path, and `art/skin.json` with its files if they drew pieces of their own.
**It worked when** their café's link draws the house; if its sign says the cat art isn't here, a file was left out.

The `mcp` grant is what lets the page read and manage their sessions as them, and only ever on their
click (`list_repos` is what the wizard's GitHub step asks for their repositories); `db` is where rooms, renames, adopted chats and the queen's notes are kept; `assets` holds files
dropped on a cat; `sample` lets the page ask Claude which cat a file is for. On a republish, omit
`capabilities` to keep what is stored: passing it replaces the whole set, so naming only some revokes
the rest.

Once their front desk is up (`harness/gateway/README.md`) and its connector is named `CATIO` in claude.ai,
republish with the whole set in `CLAUDE.md` ("The stored capabilities"), the `CATIO` server included: until then the
page can't reach the front desk. It worked when the House menu says *Gateway live* with a time.

If the sign says claude.ai won't let the page read sessions live, there is nothing for them to
switch: Claude Code Remote is built into claude.ai and has no entry in their Connectors list. The
page falls back to the saved copy from step 4, so refresh that copy instead.

### 6. Off a USB stick, if they want it

```bash
python3 catio/tools/bundle.py     # -> catio/dist/catio-local/ and a zip
```

A folder that runs from any local web server with no claude.ai at all. It also carries the Catio's own
MCP server (`harness/mcp/catio_mcp.py --serve . --port 8791`), through which agents that aren't Claude
Code sessions (Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor) join as cats. It contains their licensed
art and their session list, so it is for them alone — never share the folder or commit it.

## Adopting the things that aren't sessions

Chats on claude.ai — a business plan, a legal question — can't be read by any connector. They are
adopted by hand from a room's menu: title, link, project, mood and a note. Whatever is typed there
is stored in the artifact database and visible to anyone the page is shared with, which the form
says on its face. Keep anything sensitive in the chat itself and give the cat a bland name.

## The queen, and what she's for

The house has one queen (her call, 2 October 2026: one main character you chat with, not a cat per room). She holds what you'd otherwise have to remember, or go and look up. A note she is
*saying* becomes her line in her menu until it is taken back; the rest she just keeps.

She is deliberately not a task: she never joins the count of cats needing you, because a sign that
says "3 need you" has to mean three real pieces of work. If you change how she works, keep her out
of those counts.

## Changing the page

- **Get `catio/art/licensed/` before you look or test.** It is gitignored, so a fresh clone and every cloud
  session start without it, and without it both are blind: the screenshots show the no-art fallbacks rather
  than the page, and the check that wants no warning sign fails along with the checks of The look and a
  skin, which stand in for her own drawings. A failure outside those is real. `run.sh` says so when it
  starts and again if the run goes red; CLAUDE.md, "Republishing", has the two ways back.
- `sh catio/test/run.sh` runs the end-to-end suite in headless Chromium, against a stand-in for the
  artifact runtime and against the local bundle on a real server. Run it after every change; it
  builds the bundle as part of the run, so a broken bundler fails the suite.
- Look before you touch a test: `sh catio/test/run.sh look <room>` screenshots the page in a few seconds.
  Hold each one against what was asked; then run the suite unchanged, and rewrite only the checks the ask
  meant to break, from the ask's words rather than the code's.
- `catio/tools/manor.py` is the floor plan (two floors on one grid) and `catio/tools/furniture.py`
  places the furniture and the cats' stations and writes the page's `MANOR` block, from which `GEOM`
  comes. Change them together, re-run `furniture.py`, and check that `furniture.check()` is empty — a cat
  standing in a bathtub is a geometry bug, not a styling one.
- The queen sits on the entrance hall's held-back seat (`GEOM.hall.queen`), or on the front door room's when the
  hall is closed (`queenRoom()`); each room keeps its own `queen` seat in the drawing. Giving a room another cat seat means taking one out of `spots`, not inventing a
  coordinate, because the seats are positions on a drawing that was checked against the art.

Read `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root before anything structural. It carries the decisions this
page has already paid for.
